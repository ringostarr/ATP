The dataset contains 9999 training files and 1411 testing files.

Each file in the dataset contains a number of training examples
together with the conjecture and dependencies on which the training
example may be conditioned.

There are 2013046 training examples and 196030 testing examples in total.

Each file consists of a conjecture block, a number of dependency
blocks, and a number of training/testing example blocks.

The conjecture block starts with an 'N' and consists of 3 lines:

N <name of conjecture>
C <text representation of the conjecture>
T <tokenization of the conjecture>

Each dependency block starts with a 'D' and consists of 3 lines:

D <name of dependency>
A <text representation of the dependency>
T <tokenization of the conjecture>

Each training/testing example starts with the symbol '+' or '-'
where '+' means useful in the final proof and '-' not useful
and consists of 2 lines:

+ <text representation of the intermediate step>
T <tokenization of the intermediate step>
